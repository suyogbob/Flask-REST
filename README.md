# Flask-REST
A small web app built with Flask to learn REST API

## About the App
I built this app following some instructional Youtube tutorials from the channel TechWithTim.
The app has two versions, which are controlled using the commit history.

The first version uses an in-memory dictionary to manage state for the API.
The second version uses a SQL database to manage state.

The app simply simulates some REST methods (get, put, patch) for a dummy Video object.
